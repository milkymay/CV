### In short,
I currently enjoy being a 2-year student in *Applied Maths and Informatics* 
(strongly technical specialty, hard skills required). Apart from that, I am keen on social activity,
humans interaction and exploring my personal unknown (exciting, soft skills needed). Moreover, 
nearly two years ago I passed **IELTS** and got **8.0** score.

### In more words and more precisely,
while studying, I have been working with:
Java, Web (FreeMarker, Spring, CSS, HTML), C++ and C, Js, even had some practice in Clojure and Prolog (you can see my [github](https://github.com/milkymay) for details).
Tons of different maths, which has irreversibly expanded my mind's horizons, continue mastering
my analytical thinking skills. Extracurricular activities (music, improvisation, student non-studying life) 
helps in staying creative and communicative.

Basically, I am an enthusiastic human who is ready to think, analyse, 
interact, create, brainstorm,  code, and more.

That's all about me, my characteristics and skills; now going to 

### Motivation

The JetBrains mission *"We make professional software development
a more productive and enjoyable experience"*(which hits slightly different in Russian)
sounds magical to me, as much as *"humans over processes"* policy. 

I had a chance to
be present at a meeting with company representatives at ITMO. That's when I found out
about Grazie, which, born at a hackathon as a startup, continued being developed as a
separated JetBrains project. This story is not only inspiring, but also incredibly prepossessing
as it shows company's attitude towards interesting and perspective projects 
as much as illustrates how JB follows their policy. Apart from that, my some-years
experience of working with JB products has played an important role in building respect and excitement
towards JetBrains company. 

For me, JB seems to be a massive structure with values close
to mine, which I would really want to be a part of.


Looking forward to cooperating with JetBrains,

*Melissa*
